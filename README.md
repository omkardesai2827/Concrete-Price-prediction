# Concrete Strength prediction

Check out the script for the models that are created to predict the strength of concrete. It includes every step that is required to be followed while creating a machine learning model.

# Uses:

1)Predict the strength of concrete with 94% accuracy.

2)Understand which independent factors have major impact on the strength of concrete

3)Strength prediction of concrete would help to get an idea about the age of construction projetcs where conceret is used as a material.

# Procedure:

## 1) Data Preprocessing, EDA and Data Engineering

####  Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, autoviz

## 2) Model Building
####  Libraries used: Scikit-learn, Statsmodels

## 3)Challenges (Multicollinearity & Heteroscedasticity)
#### Libraries used: Statsmodels, Scikit-learn

## 4) Feature selection and Overfitting
#### Libraries used: Scikit-learn, mlxtend, Statsmodels

## 5) Determine which model is the best
#### Libraries used: Pycaret, Xgboost

# Results:
#### 1) Training accuracy is 97% i.e coefficient of determination.

#### 2) Testing accuracy is 94% i.e coefficient of determination.
